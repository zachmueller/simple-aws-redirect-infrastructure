# Plan Workflow

Execute the implementation planning workflow using the plan template to generate design artifacts.

## Description
This workflow creates comprehensive implementation plans from feature specifications. It handles technical architecture decisions, data modeling, API contract generation, and creates the foundation for task breakdown and implementation.

## Usage
Run this workflow to:
- Generate technical implementation plans from specifications
- Create data models and API contracts
- Set up research and design artifacts
- Prepare for task breakdown and implementation

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Setup and Validation
Load feature context and validate prerequisites:

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Verify spec exists
ls specs/*/spec.md

# Check for existing plan
ls specs/*/plan.md
```

Parse feature directory structure and validate that specification is complete.

### Step 2: Load Implementation Plan Template
Create or load the implementation plan template structure:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE NAME]

**Created:** [DATE]
**Specification:** [Link to spec.md]
**Status:** Planning

```

### Step 3: Fill Technical Context
Analyze the specification and fill in technical decisions:

2. **Assess Complexity:** Determine appropriate architecture scale
3. **Identify Integration Needs:** External services, APIs, data sources
4. **Security Requirements:** Authentication, authorization, data protection
5. **Performance Needs:** Scalability, response time, throughput requirements

**Decision Process:**

### Step 4: Phase 0 - Research Tasks
Generate research tasks for unresolved technical decisions:

**Research Generation:**
- For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → create research task
- For each major technology choice → create best practices task  
- For each integration → create patterns research task
- For each security requirement → create security analysis task

## Quality Guidelines

### Architecture Decision Documentation
Each major technical decision should include:
1. **Context:** What situation led to this decision
2. **Options:** Alternatives that were considered  
3. **Decision:** What was chosen and why
4. **Consequences:** Expected positive and negative outcomes
5. **Reversibility:** How difficult it would be to change this decision

### Data Model Best Practices
- **Normalize appropriately:** Balance normalization vs. performance
- **Plan for scale:** Consider future growth and performance needs
- **Validate early:** Ensure model supports all business rules
- **Document assumptions:** Make implicit rules explicit
- **Consider privacy:** Address data protection and compliance needs

### API Design Principles  
- **RESTful patterns:** Follow standard REST conventions where applicable
- **Consistent naming:** Use clear, consistent naming throughout
- **Version planning:** Design for API evolution and backward compatibility
- **Security first:** Integrate security into API design, not as afterthought
- **Error handling:** Provide clear, actionable error messages

## Dependencies

- Optional: Existing architecture documentation or standards

## Outputs
- `specs/[feature]/plan.md` - Complete implementation plan

## Next Steps
After running this workflow:
- Run `speckit-5-tasks` workflow to break down implementation into specific tasks
