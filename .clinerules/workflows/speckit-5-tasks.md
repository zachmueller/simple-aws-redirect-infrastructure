# Tasks Workflow

Generate detailed task breakdown from implementation plan and specification.

## Description
This workflow creates comprehensive task lists that break down implementation plans into actionable, sequenced tasks. It handles dependency management, parallel execution planning, and creates the foundation for systematic implementation.

## Usage
Run this workflow to:
- Break down implementation plans into specific tasks
- Organize tasks by phases and dependencies
- Identify parallel vs sequential execution requirements
- Create detailed task descriptions with file paths and acceptance criteria
- Prepare for systematic implementation execution

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Setup and Prerequisites Validation
Load implementation context and validate readiness for task breakdown:

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Check current feature branch
git branch --show-current

# Verify implementation plan exists
ls specs/*/plan.md

# Check for existing task file
ls specs/*/tasks.md

# Load specification for requirements context
cat specs/*/spec.md

# Load implementation plan for technical context
cat specs/*/plan.md
```

Validate that implementation plan is complete and ready for task breakdown.

### Step 2: Load Implementation Context
Extract key information from implementation artifacts:

**From Implementation Plan (`plan.md`):**
- Architecture and technology stack decisions
- Data model references and entity relationships
- API contract specifications
- Technical constraints and requirements
- Phase breakdown and dependencies

**From Specification (`spec.md`):**
- Functional requirements and acceptance criteria
- User scenarios and edge cases
- Non-functional requirements
- Success criteria and validation points

**From Additional Artifacts (if present):**
- `data-model.md`: Entity definitions and relationships
- `contracts/`: API specifications and test requirements
- `research.md`: Technical decisions and constraints
- `quickstart.md`: Development environment and setup requirements

### Step 3: Task Breakdown Structure
Organize tasks into systematic phases with clear dependencies:

**Phase Structure:**
1. **Setup Phase**: Project initialization, dependencies, configuration
2. **Foundation Phase**: Core architecture, data models, basic structure
3. **Core Phase**: Primary feature implementation, business logic
4. **Integration Phase**: External services, API endpoints, data flow
5. **Quality Phase**: Testing, validation, performance optimization
6. **Polish Phase**: Documentation, deployment preparation, final validation

**Task Categorization:**
- **Sequential Tasks**: Must be completed in order (dependencies)
- **Parallel Tasks [P]**: Can be executed simultaneously 
- **Validation Tasks**: Quality gates and checkpoints
- **Documentation Tasks**: Technical and user documentation

### Step 4: Generate Task Template Structure
Create comprehensive task breakdown template:

```markdown

**Created:** [DATE]
**Implementation Plan:** [Link to plan.md]
**Specification:** [Link to spec.md]

### Step 5: Task Generation Process
Create specific tasks based on implementation plan analysis:

**Task Identification Algorithm:**
1. **Extract Components:** Identify major components from architecture and data model
2. **Map Requirements:** Link each functional requirement to implementation tasks
3. **Identify Dependencies:** Determine task sequencing and dependency chains
4. **Find Parallelization:** Identify tasks that can run simultaneously
5. **Add Quality Gates:** Insert validation and testing tasks at appropriate points
6. **Include Documentation:** Add documentation tasks for each major component

**Task Detailing Process:**
For each identified task:
- **Generate ID:** Use phase prefix + sequential number (e.g., FEAT-001)
- **Write Description:** Clear, actionable task description
- **Identify Files:** Specific files that will be created or modified
- **Map Dependencies:** Tasks that must complete before this task
- **Define Acceptance Criteria:** Specific, measurable completion criteria
- **Add Commands:** Relevant setup or validation commands where applicable

### Step 6: Dependency Analysis and Sequencing
Analyze and optimize task dependencies:

**Dependency Types:**
- **Hard Dependencies:** Task A must complete before Task B can start
- **Soft Dependencies:** Task A should complete before Task B for optimal flow
- **Resource Dependencies:** Tasks that cannot run simultaneously due to shared resources
- **Integration Dependencies:** Tasks that require integration points to be established

**Parallel Execution Identification:**
- Mark tasks with `[P]` that can execute in parallel with others in same phase
- Group related parallel tasks for efficient execution
- Ensure parallel tasks don't have file conflicts or shared resource issues
- Balance parallel execution with system resource constraints

**Critical Path Analysis:**
- Identify longest dependency chain (critical path)
- Optimize task sequencing to minimize total implementation time
- Highlight bottleneck tasks that could delay overall completion
- Suggest parallel alternatives where possible

### Step 7: Validation and Quality Gates
Integrate quality validation throughout task breakdown:

**Phase Gates:**
Each phase should end with validation tasks that ensure:
- Phase objectives completed successfully
- Quality standards maintained
- Dependencies satisfied for next phase
- No regressions introduced

**Acceptance Criteria Validation:**
For each task, ensure acceptance criteria are:
- **Specific:** Clear, unambiguous completion conditions
- **Measurable:** Objective verification possible
- **Achievable:** Realistic given constraints and dependencies
- **Relevant:** Directly supports specification requirements
- **Time-bound:** Can be completed in reasonable timeframe

**Quality Standards:**
- Ensure quality standards maintained throughout implementation
- Include validation checkpoints in appropriate tasks

### Step 8: Task File Generation and Validation
Create complete tasks.md file with validation:

**File Structure Validation:**
- All phases represented with appropriate tasks
- Task IDs unique and follow naming convention
- Dependencies properly mapped and achievable
- Parallel execution markers `[P]` used correctly
- Acceptance criteria complete and measurable

**Completeness Check:**
- All functional requirements from spec.md addressed
- All technical components from plan.md covered
- Quality and testing tasks included
- Documentation and deployment tasks present
- Security and compliance requirements addressed

**Cross-Reference Validation:**
- Tasks reference correct files and components
- Dependencies exist and are reachable
- No circular dependencies created
- Critical path identified and optimized

### Step 9: Finalize and Report
Complete task breakdown and prepare for implementation:

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Add task breakdown file
git add specs/*/tasks.md

# Commit task breakdown
git commit -m "feat: add task breakdown for [feature-name]

- [total-tasks] tasks across 6 implementation phases
- Dependency mapping and parallel execution planning
- Quality gates and validation checkpoints
- Ready for systematic implementation execution"
```

**Completion Report:**
- Task file path and total task count
- Phase breakdown summary
- Parallel execution opportunities
- Critical path analysis
- Estimated implementation complexity
- Readiness for `implement` workflow

## Quality Guidelines

### Effective Task Breakdown
**Task Granularity:**
- Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours of focused work
- Large tasks should be broken down into subtasks
- Atomic tasks that can be independently validated
- Clear deliverables and success criteria

**Dependency Management:**
- Minimize unnecessary dependencies to enable parallelization
- Make dependencies explicit and justify them
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Plan for dependency changes during implementation

**Acceptance Criteria Quality:**
- Each task must have clear completion criteria
- Criteria should be testable and verifiable
- Link to specification requirements where applicable
- Include both functional and quality validation

### Implementation Readiness
**File and Component Planning:**
- Identify specific files that will be created or modified
- Plan component interfaces and integration points
- Consider file organization and architecture consistency
- Plan for configuration and environment-specific files

**Quality Integration:**
- Include testing tasks throughout implementation phases
- Plan for continuous integration and validation
- Include performance and security validation tasks
- Ensure documentation tasks cover all major components
