# Implement Workflow

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Description
This workflow systematically executes implementation tasks with built-in quality gates, progress tracking, and validation checkpoints. It handles phase-by-phase execution, dependency management, and ensures quality standards throughout implementation.

## Usage
Run this workflow to:
- Execute implementation tasks in proper sequence
- Validate quality gates and checkpoints
- Track progress and handle task dependencies
- Ensure quality standards throughout implementation
- Manage parallel and sequential task execution

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Prerequisites and Setup Validation
Validate environment and readiness for implementation:

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Check current feature branch
git branch --show-current

# Verify required files exist
ls specs/*/tasks.md
ls specs/*/plan.md
ls specs/*/spec.md

# Check git repository status
git status --porcelain
```

Ensure all prerequisite artifacts are complete and environment is ready.

### Step 2: Checklist Status Validation
Check completion status of all quality checklists before proceeding:

**Checklist Scanning Process:**
```bash
# Scan for checklist files
ls specs/*/checklists/

# Check each checklist for completion status
# Count total vs completed items for each checklist
```

**Status Analysis:**
For each checklist file, count:
- **Total items:** All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
- **Completed items:** Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
- **Incomplete items:** Lines matching `- [ ]`

**Create Status Table:**
```
| Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
| api.md    | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
| security.md| 6    | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
```

**Gate Decision:**
- **PASS:** All checklists have 0 incomplete items → Proceed automatically
- **FAIL:** One or more checklists have incomplete items → Stop and ask user

**If FAIL:**
Display incomplete checklist table and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
- Wait for user response before continuing
- If "no"/"wait"/"stop" → Halt execution with guidance to complete checklists
- If "yes"/"proceed"/"continue" → Continue to Step 3 with warning logged

### Step 3: Load Implementation Context
Load and analyze all implementation artifacts:

**Required Artifacts:**
- **tasks.md:** Complete task list and execution plan
- **plan.md:** Tech stack, architecture, and file structure  
- **spec.md:** Requirements and acceptance criteria

**Optional Artifacts:**
- **data-model.md:** Entity definitions and relationships
- **contracts/:** API specifications and test requirements
- **research.md:** Technical decisions and constraints
- **quickstart.md:** Development environment setup

**Context Extraction:**
- Parse task breakdown structure and dependencies
- Extract technology stack and architecture decisions
- Identify file paths and component relationships

### Step 4: Project Setup Verification
Verify and create essential project files based on detected setup:

**Technology Detection:**
```bash
# Check if git repository
git rev-parse --git-dir

# Detect technology stack from plan.md and existing files
# Check for package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.
# Scan for Docker, ESLint, Prettier configurations
```

**Ignore File Management:**
Based on detected technologies, create or verify ignore files:

**Git Repository (.gitignore):**
- **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript:** `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
- **Python:** `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
- **Java:** `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`
- **C#/.NET:** `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`
- **Universal:** `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`

**Additional Ignore Files (if applicable):**
- **.dockerignore:** If Dockerfile exists or Docker mentioned in plan
- **.eslintignore:** If ESLint configuration detected
- **.prettierignore:** If Prettier configuration exists
- **.npmignore:** If package.json exists and publishing planned

**Creation Logic:**
- If ignore file exists: Verify essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
- If ignore file missing: Create with full pattern set for detected technology
- Preserve existing custom patterns while adding standard ones

### Step 5: Parse Task Structure and Dependencies
Analyze tasks.md for execution planning:

**Task Structure Extraction:**
- **Task Phases:** Setup, Foundation, Core, Integration, Quality, Polish
- **Task Dependencies:** Sequential vs parallel execution rules
- **Task Details:** ID, description, file paths, acceptance criteria
- **Parallel Markers:** Tasks marked with `[P]` for concurrent execution

**Dependency Graph Analysis:**
- Build dependency graph from task relationships
- Identify critical path (longest dependency chain)
- Find parallelization opportunities within constraints
- Validate no circular dependencies exist

**Execution Planning:**
- Group tasks by phase for sequential phase execution
- Within phases, identify parallel execution groups
- Plan resource allocation for concurrent tasks
- Prepare validation checkpoints between phases

### Step 6: Phase-by-Phase Implementation Execution
Execute tasks following the structured approach:

**Execution Rules:**
- **Phase Completion:** Complete entire phase before moving to next
- **Dependency Respect:** Sequential tasks run in order, parallel tasks `[P]` can run together
- **TDD Approach:** Execute test setup tasks before implementation tasks where applicable
- **File Coordination:** Tasks affecting same files must run sequentially
- **Validation Checkpoints:** Verify phase completion before proceeding

**Phase Execution Process:**

#### Phase 0: Setup & Environment

- Development environment setup
- Dependency installation and configuration
- Project structure initialization
- Build system and tooling configuration

### Step 7: Task Execution Management
Handle individual task execution with proper tracking:

**Task Execution Process:**
1. **Pre-Task Validation:** Verify dependencies satisfied
2. **Task Execution:** Execute task following acceptance criteria
3. **Progress Tracking:** Mark task as completed in tasks.md
4. **Validation:** Verify acceptance criteria satisfied
5. **Error Handling:** Handle failures and dependencies

**Progress Tracking:**
- Update tasks.md with completed tasks marked as `[X]`
- Log completion timestamp and validation results
- Track overall progress and phase completion
- Report blocking issues and dependency problems

**Error Handling:**
- **Non-Parallel Task Failure:** Halt execution, report error with context
- **Parallel Task Failure:** Continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
- **Dependency Failure:** Block dependent tasks, suggest resolution
- **Validation Failure:** Roll back if possible, require manual intervention

### Step 8: Progress Tracking and Reporting
Provide comprehensive progress tracking throughout implementation:

**Progress Metrics:**
- **Phase Completion:** Current phase and overall progress percentage
- **Task Completion:** Completed tasks vs total tasks
- **Quality Gates:** Passed/failed validation checkpoints  
- **Blocking Issues:** Unresolved dependencies or failures

**Progress Reporting Format:**
```
